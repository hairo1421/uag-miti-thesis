# Thesis UAG MITC: Economic Forecasting Using Transformers and Econometrics

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for my master's thesis on forecasting Mexico's GDP using advanced machine learning models, such as Transformers, and traditional econometric approaches.

## Structure
- `thesis/`: Main documents for the thesis (proposal, draft, references).
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
- `code/`: Scripts for data exploration, modeling, and utilities.
- `results/`: Visualizations, tables, and model outputs.
- `presentations/`: Slides for defense and updates.
- `references/`: Papers, books, and other supporting materials.

## Objectives
1. Compare the performance of Transformers against econometric models for time series forecasting.
2. Evaluate the impact of incorporating external unstructured data, such as news.
3. Provide insights into the most effective forecasting methodologies for economic activity.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/thesis-economic-forecasting.git`
2. Explore the notebooks in the `code/` folder for details on the analysis.
3. Refer to `thesis/` for the latest updates on the written thesis.
